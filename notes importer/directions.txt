Great — I’ve baked your Firebase config into the importer for you.

Download notes-importer_with_config.html

Quick steps to run

Serve it locally (don’t open with file://):

# from the folder with notes-importer_with_config.html
npx serve .
# or
python -m http.server 8080
# or
npx http-server -p 8080


Open the printed URL (e.g., http://localhost:3000 or http://localhost:8080).

In Firebase Console → Authentication → Sign-in method, ensure Google is enabled.

In Authentication → Settings → Authorized domains, add:

localhost

Load the page, click Sign in with Google, pick your Excel/CSV, and import.
